## Multi-Layer Perceptron Particle Filter

Code used for the publication of [DATA-DRIVEN PROGNOSTICS WITH MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON PARTICLE FILTER: A CROSS-INDUSTRY EXPLORATION](https://doi.org/10.36001/phme.2024.v8i1.4034).

It can be used for predicting linear or non-linear degradation trajectories. Examples and application cases on Lithium-Ion batteries (prediction of the capacity degradation), Fatigue Crack Growth and estimation of a Virtual Health Indicator developed for turbofans.
